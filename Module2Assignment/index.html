No meat feast is complete without Chicken Lollipop, as it is an absolute favourite among chicken lovers. These 'Frenched' or trimmed chicken wings are immensely flavourful owing to the inclusion of meat, fat and the bone. After cutting loose from the wing bone, the meat is rolled to one end to create a drumstick, to provide a clean bone for a handle.
